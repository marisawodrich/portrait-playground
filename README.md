# abstract_portrait_maker
## our first website 
* link to the website: https://marisawodrich.github.io/portrait-playground/
* On our website, the user can create an abstract portrait. For that, he can choose between 3 images, how many lines the portrait will have, how thick those lines are, how long they can be and the color of them. The user can push a button to start the drawing process.

## code structure
### index.html file
* contains the different element for our website and how they are structured
  * we have a header, a canvas element, 3 select-from-options buttons, one iput (type in) button, a color chooser button and a simple push button
### canvas.js file
* contains the canvas elements and the main algorithm which computes how to draw the portrait
* contains all the actions (what happens to the program when the user changes something with the buttons)
### styles.css file
* contains the styles for the different elements the website has
 
## other file 
* in the folder "images" we have our images that we use for the website
