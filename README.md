## our first website 
* link to the website: https://marisawodrich.github.io/portrait-playground/
* On the website, the user can create an abstract portrait. For that, he can choose between several images, how many lines the portrait will have, how thick those lines are, how long they can be and the color of them. The user can push a button to start the drawing process.
